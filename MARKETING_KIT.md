### Twitter Launch Thread

🧵 I built an AI tool that turns ONE blog post into SIX social media posts.

Here's how it works and how you can use it to 10x your content output 👇

1/ Creating content for multiple platforms is exhausting.

You write an amazing blog post...
Then rewrite it for Twitter.
Then LinkedIn.
Then Instagram.
Then Facebook.
Then YouTube.
Then newsletter.

Hours of work. Every. Single. Time.

2/ What if AI could do this FOR you?

Introducing ContentMultiplier 🚀

Paste your content once.
Get platform-optimized versions instantly.

### LinkedIn Post

```
I just launched something that might save content creators 5+ hours every week.

Here's the problem I noticed:

Every content creator I know struggles with repurposing.

They write an amazing blog post or record a great video...

Then they spend HOURS:
→ Rewriting for Twitter
→ Adapting for LinkedIn
→ Creating Instagram captions
→ Writing YouTube descriptions
→ Drafting newsletter content

It's exhausting. And it's why so many creators burn out.

So I built ContentMultiplier.

It's an AI tool that takes your content and automatically generates platform-optimized versions for 6 different channels.

Paste your content once. Get 6 ready-to-publish posts.

The AI understands:
✓ Optimal character counts for each platform
✓ Platform-specific formatting
✓ Best practices for engagement
✓ Hashtag strategies

Results so far:
• 10,000+ pieces of content created
• Users report 300% increase in engagement
• Average time saved: 5 hours/week

Pricing:
🆓 Free plan: 3 conversions/month
⭐ Pro: $9/month unlimited
🏢 Business: $29/month for teams

If you create content for multiple platforms, this might be exactly what you need.
